# Apache Zeppelin

Apache Zeppelin is born in the Korea a few year ago as a project to create data visualization in the context of big data.
It aims at providing a single entry point for all your big data needs.
You can :

- create programs (using several languages such as Scala or Python)
- create visualization 
- share with other users


Apache Zeppelin provides a lot of interpreter to access any kind of data source: SQL database (through a JDBC interpreter), Cassandra, ... and Elasticsearch.
